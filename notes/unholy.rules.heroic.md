## Other Attributes

### Hit Points

Hit points track your capacity to fight and push on through physical hardship.

**Armour** helps you absorb damage in combat, and its value is simply added to your hit points (or removed if you take it off).

**Level** rates your achievements as a hero. It starts at 1 for a new character, and increases as you gain experience.

**XP** is a measure of your adventuring experience. You gain xp by completing sessions, defeating powerful foes of higher level than you, retreiving valuable treasure, and performing certain moves. Once you have enough your level increases.

| Level | XP  |
|-------|-----|
| 1     | 0   |
| 2     | 3   |
| 3     | 6   |
| 4     | 9   |
| 5     | 12  |
| 6     | 15  |
| 7     | 20  |
| 8     | 25  |
| 9     | 30  |
| 10    | 35  |
| 11    | 40  |
| 12    | 50  |

| 15    | 80  |
| 16    | 100 |
| 17    | 125 |
| 18    | 150 |

**Speed** measures how far you can run, in units of five feet. It is equal to 6 plus your Dexterity.

## Moves

Moves are the way you resolve uncertain, risky, or dangerous actions or events. Most (but not all) moves involve rolling a D20 and adding one of your abilities; with higher results being better. Each move explains how to use it, and the results for each total. Generally speaking a total of less than 10 means failure; a total of 1 to 14 means getting a mixed result, or facing a hard choice; and a roll of 15 or higher means success.

The DM has moves to make too, but they're not listed here.



### Special Moves

When you strike an unsuspecting target without warning ask the DM if you could miss. If so choose an appropriate combat move. If not they take a critical hit.

When you hit a target roll the damage dice for the attack. The target loses hit points equal to the result. When you take a hit the DM will tell you how many hit points you lose.

When you help an ally they get +1 on their next roll.

### Combat Moves

When you brawl, fight in single combat, or otherwise exchange blows, roll 1D20 and add your Strength:

## Hit Points, Damage, and Healing

Hit points are reduced when you take damage, either in combat or from some other violent action or event. Hit points measure stamina and minor injury; depleting as you tire from combat and physical exertion. If you reach zero hitpoints you pass out. If you go below zero hitpoints, Going below zero hit points is usually very bad, but exactly what going it means for your character depends on your class. For monsters and NPCs it is up to the DM; for most non combatant NPCs, it means death.

Hit points can be recovered by resting. A short rest to simply catch your breath (anything from a few minutes to a couple of hours) recovers half your hit points, rounded down. A long rest, meaning a good night's sleep, or the equivalent, recovers you to your maximum. And there are of course magical means to recover health.
