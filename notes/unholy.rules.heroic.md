# Abilities

You have six abilities that are used to make moves: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Perception, and Charisma, each scored from -5 to +5.

# Attributes

**Hit points** count the number of telling blows you can take in combat before passing out (or worse). You start with hit points equal to your level, plus your Strength, plus your Armour.

**Armour** helps you absorb damage in combat, and its value is simply added to your hit points (or removed if you take it off).

**Level** rates your achievements as a hero. It starts at 1 for a new character, and increases as you gain experience.

**XP** is a measure of your adventuring experience. You gain xp by completing sessions, defeating powerful foes of higher level than you, retreiving valuable treasure, and performing certain moves. Once you have enough your level increases.


| Level | XP  |
|-------|-----|
| 1     | 0   |
| 2     | 3   |
| 3     | 6   |
| 4     | 9   |
| 5     | 12  |
| 6     | 15  |
| 7     | 20  |
| 8     | 25  |
| 9     | 30  |
| 10    | 35  |
| 11    | 40  |
| 12    | 50  |
| 13    | 60  |
| 14    | 70  |
| 15    | 80  |
| 16    | 100 |
| 17    | 120 |
| 18    | 140 |

**Speed** measures how far you can run, in units of five feet. It is equal to 6 plus your Dexterity.

# Moves

Moves are the way you resolve uncertain, risky, or dangerous actions or events. Most (but not all) moves involve rolling a D20 and adding one of your abilities; with higher results being better. Each move explains how to use it, and the results for each total. Generally speaking a total of less than 10 means failure; a total of 1 to 14 means getting a mixed result, or facing a hard choice; and a roll of 15 or higher means success.

The DM has moves to make too, but they're not listed here.

## Basic Moves

## Special Moves

Special moves either don't require rolls, or have unusual rolls. Each class adds one or more additional special moves, which are described in the rules for that class. 

When you _strike without warning_ ask the DM if you could miss. If so count it as _exchange blows_ or _strike from range_, as appropriate. If not _deal damage_. Either way, if your enemies survive, _combat breaks out_.

When you _deal damage_ roll the damage dice for the attack. The target loses hit points equal to the result.

When you _take damage_ the DM will tell you how many hit points you lose.

When you _help_ an ally they get +1 on their next roll.

If you're the lead character when _combat breaks out_ roll 1D20 and add your Dexterity:

| Roll | Result                     |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1-9  | The other side acts first. |
| 10+  | Your side acts first.      |

While in combat you can use combat moves, with each character, monster, and so on making one brief action per round (and rolling if necessary). If you find yourself making a combat move before combat has broken out; then combat breaks out first.

# Combat Moves

If you roll a natural 20 on a combat move, you may choose to _deal damage_ on top of the normal result (which may mean dealing damage twice).

When you _exchange blows_ roll 1D20 and add your Strength:

| Roll  | Result                                |
|-------|---------------------------------------|

|       | - Deal damage, but take damage too.   |
|       | - Deal damage, but fall back.         |

# Hit Points, Damage, and Healing

Hit points are reduced when you take damage, either in combat or from some other violent action or event. Hit points measure stamina and minor injury; depleting as you tire from combat and physical exertion. If you reach zero hitpoints you pass out. If you go below zero hitpoints, Going below zero hit points is usually very bad, but exactly what going it means for your character depends on your class. For monsters and NPCs it is up to the DM; for most non combatant NPCs, it means death.

Hit points can be recovered by resting. A short rest to simply catch your breath (anything from a few minutes to a couple of hours) recovers 1 hit point. A long rest, meaning a good night's sleep, or the equivalent, recovers you to your maximum. And there are of course magical means to recover health.
