# Unholy Heroic

## Abilities Scores & Ability Checks

You have six abilities that are used to make moves: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Willpower each scored from -5 to +5. Ability checks are made by rolling 1D20 and adding the appropriate Ability Scores. Ability checks are used to to test your skill, with higher rolls meaning better results.

## Other Attributes

### Hit Points

**Hit points** track your capacity to fight and push on through physical hardship.

**Armour** helps you absorb damage in combat, and its value is simply added to your hit points (or removed if you take it off).

**Speed** measures how far you can run, in units of five feet. It is equal to 6 plus your Dexterity.

**Level** rates your achievements as a hero. It starts at 1 for a new character, and increases as you gain experience.

**XP** is a measure of your adventuring experience. You gain xp by completing sessions, defeating powerful foes of higher level than you, retreiving valuable treasure, and performing certain moves. Once you have enough your level increases.

| Level | XP  |
|-------|-----|
| 1     | 0   |
| 2     | 3   |
| 3     | 6   |
| 4     | 9   |

| 6     | 15  |
| 7     | 20  |
| 8     | 25  |

## Actions

In normal play the DM will describe a scene, you will tell the DM what actions you take, and the DM will narrate the results. Some actions, like talking, walking, and running, have no specific rules; they just play out as you would expect. Some actions, particularly actions that involve some element of risk, trigger moves. When a move is triggered, resolve its rules as described and then return to normal play.

## Moves

Moves kick in in response to certain actions. To make a move you have to do the thing it describes; and if you do the thing a move describes, then you have to make the move. In other words, you have to do it to do it.

### Utilize

When you use a non-magical object, you just do it, unless it has some special rules...

## Hit Points, Damage, and Healing

Hit points are reduced when you take damage, either in combat or from some other violent action or event.

Hit points measure stamina and deplete as you tire from physical exertion. If you reach zero hitpoints you pass out.

Going below zero hit points is usually very bad, but exactly what it means for your character depends on your class. For monsters and NPCs it is up to the DM; for most non combatant NPCs, it means death.

Hit points can be recovered by resting. A short rest to simply catch your breath (anything from a few minutes to a couple of hours) recovers half your hit points, rounded down. A long rest, meaning a good night's sleep, or the equivalent, recovers you to your maximum. And there are of course magical means to recover health.

## Combat

In combat actions are tracked more carefully. Each round the DM will describe what threats are facing you, and ask each player to choose one brief action to take in response. If your action triggers a move (which it commonly will) resolve that move as normal.
