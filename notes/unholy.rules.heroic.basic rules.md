## Abilities and Checks

You have six abilities that are used to make moves: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Willpower normally scored from 1 to 20; though some monsters may have scores up to 30. Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a test with that ability.

| Ability | Modifier |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | -5       |
| 2-3     | -4       |
| 4-5     | -3       |
| 6-7     | -2       |
| 8-9     | -1       |
| 10-11   | 0        |
| 12-13   | +1       |
| 14-15   | +2       |
| 16-17   | +3       |
| 18-19   | +4       |
| 20-21   | +5       |
| 22-23   | +6       |
| 24-25   | +7       |
| 26-27   | +8       |
| 28-29   | +9       |
| 30      | +10      |

To test an ability (usually as required by a move) roll 2d10 and add the relevant ability modifier, plus any other relevant modifiers such as your proficiency bonus. Then compare your result to the Difficulty Range (DR) for the test. If the result is below the DR it is a failure, if it is within the DR it is a mixed success, and if it is above the DR it is a success.

### Typical Difficulty Bands

| Difficulty        | Difficulty Range |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Easy              | 10-15           |
| Medium            | 15-20           |
| Hard              | 20-25           |
| Very Hard         | 25-30           |
| Nearly Impossible | 30-35           |

_Conversion note: If a DC is given in the text, the lower bound of the Difficulty Band is the same as the DC, and the upper bound is equal to the DC + 5. E.g. DC 15 becomes DR 15-20._

## Advantage & Disadvantage

If you have advantage on a roll, roll 3D10 and take the two highest results before adding modifiers. If you have disadvantage roll 3D10 and take the two lowest results.

_Conversion note: Saving Throws don't exist in this rule set. They are replaced by moves such as Dodge, Escape, and Focus. A character which has proficiency in a given saving throw has proficiency in the appropriate move instead._

## Proficiency Bonus

Your class or background might give you 'proficiency' in certain skills, tools, or specific actions. In these cases you can add your proficiency bonus (determined by your level) to tests with those skills, tools, etc.

## Other Attributes

### Hit Points

**Hit points** track your capacity to fight and push on through physical hardship.

**Armour** helps you absorb damage in combat, and its value is simply added to your hit points (or removed if you take it off).

**Speed** measures how far you can run, in units of five feet. It is equal to 6 plus your Dexterity.

**Level** rates your achievements as a hero. It starts at 1 for a new character, and increases as you gain experience.

**XP** is a measure of your adventuring experience. You gain xp by completing sessions, defeating powerful foes of higher level than you, retreiving valuable treasure, and performing certain moves. Once you have enough your level increases.

## Actions

In normal play the DM will describe a scene, you will tell the DM what actions you take, and the DM will narrate the results. Some actions, like talking, walking, and running, have no specific rules; they just play out as you would expect. Some actions, particularly actions that involve some element of risk, trigger moves. When a move is triggered, resolve its rules as described and then return to normal play.

## Moves

Moves kick in in response to certain actions. To make a move you have to do the thing it describes; and if you do the thing a move describes, then you have to make the move. In other words, you have to do it to do it.

## Combat

In combat actions are tracked more carefully. Each round the DM will describe what threats are facing you, and ask each player to choose one brief action to take in response. If your action triggers a move (which it commonly will) resolve that move as normal.

_Conversion note: Using moves means there's no need for initiative._

## Hits and Healing

### Hits

Weapons and damaging spells and monster abilities each deal a number of hits. Usually one strike with a weapon equals one hit, but more powerful and magical weapons and abilities can deal multiple hits.

_Conversion note: To convert damage for a 5e attack to hits, take the number of _dice_ of damage that the attack would deal instead, plus any modifiers. E.g. a weapon that deals  2d6+2 damage would deal 4 hits._

Each time you take a hit you lose a hit point. Hit points are basically stamina. They are reduced by taking hits in combat and by other effects that deplete your physical reserves.

### Critical Hits

If you roll a double 10 on a test that deals one or more hits, you do double damage.

### Damage Types

Each attack has a damage type, e.g. bludgeoning damage or psychic damage. A creature with resistance to a specific damage type halves the numer of hits it takes from attacks that deal that type of damage. A creature with vulnerability to a specific damage type takes double the number of hits from attacks that deal that type of damage.

Creatures with immunity to a specific damage type take no hits from attacks that deal that type of damage.

### Recovery

Hit points can be recovered by magical means, or through rest. A short rest of a few minutes to a few hours recovers half your hit points, rounded down. A long rest equivalent to a night's sleep recovers all your hit points.

### Zero Hit Points & Below

When a creature drops to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious.

When a creature reaches negative hit points, it is dying. Creatures that are dying lose 1 hit point per round until they are either saved through medical or magical intervention, or die.

If an NPC or monster reaches negative hit points equal to its hit point maximum, it dies. If your character reaches hit points equal to your hit point maximum, you trigger the Fate move listed for your character's class to see if you live or die.

### Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points stack on top of your normal hit points for the duration of the effect that granted them, and can't be recovered by healing or rest.

_Conversion note: Temporary hit points granted by 5e features should be divided by 10 (to a minimum of 1)._
