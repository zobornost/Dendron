### Level 1

#### Rage

When you fly into a violet rage in combat, you gain the following effects:

- Resistance to bludgening, piercing, and slashing damage.
- Additional damage on attacks that use strength (see table).
- Advantage on all strength checks and saving throws.
- You can't maintain concentration, and you can't cast spells.

Your rage lasts until the end of the combat, but ends early if you don't act aggressively on your turn.

You can use this move the number of times listed in the 'Rages' column of the Barbarian table. Short rests recover 1 use, and long rests recover all uses.
