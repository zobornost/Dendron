## Determine ability scores

Assign each of the following numbers to an ability score: 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 8
Random generation: Roll 4d6 and record the total of the highest 3. Do this 6 more times so you have 7 numbers; then assign these numbers to your ability scores as you see fit.
Point buy: Each ability score starts at 8; and you have 27 points to distribute between them as you see fit, up to a maximum of 15 per ability.

Note the ability scores and modifiers on your character sheet.
